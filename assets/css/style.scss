/* Targets an element with class .project-name or .site-title if it is a direct child of body,
   or a child of the body's first child element (like a top banner div/header). 
   This is to avoid hiding these classes if used elsewhere, like the main page title you want to keep. */

/* If the above doesn't work, the element might be structured differently.
   For example, it might be an h1 or p tag directly within a top-level header. 
   Inspecting the element with browser developer tools is the best way to find the exact selector. */

/* If the above doesn't work for jekyll-theme-minimal, 
   the element holding the repository name at the top might be different.
   Another common element is just `p > a` within the header if it's a simple link.
